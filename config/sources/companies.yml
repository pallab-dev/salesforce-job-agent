# Company board source config (Greenhouse / Lever / future Workday)
# Add entries and set active: true to fetch from those company career boards.
# This lets you add many company sources without changing Python code.
#
# Notes:
# - Greenhouse uses "board_token" (the company board slug in Greenhouse URLs)
# - Lever uses "company_slug" (the slug in api.lever.co/v0/postings/<slug>)
# - Keep only companies you care about to avoid noise and rate limits
# - Most FAANG + Salesforce career pages are not Greenhouse/Lever (often Workday/custom)
# - Add FAANG/Salesforce targets below so we can wire them quickly when Workday/custom adapters are implemented
